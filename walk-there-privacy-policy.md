## **Privacy Policy for Walk There**

**Effective Date:** February 9, 2026

### **Overview**

WalkThere ("the App") is a simple navigation tool that shows you the bearing and distance to any destination. We, the developers, are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how the App works.

---

### **Information We Collect**

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from the App.**

All data you create in WalkThere stays on your device and is never sent to our servers. Specifically:

- **Saved destinations:** Stored locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple's on-device storage
- **App preferences and settings:** Stored locally on your device
- **Location data:** Used only in real-time for navigation calculations and never stored or transmitted

With the exception of:

- **Search queries:** which are sent to Apple's servers for the purposes of finding destinations to route to.

---

### **Location Data**

The App requires access to your device location to function. This location data:

- Is used only to calculate bearing and distance to your chosen destination
- Is processed entirely on your device in real-time
- Is never stored, logged, or saved by the App
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party, with the exception of Apple, for the purposes of scoping search results to your current location
- Requires your explicit permission to access
- Can be revoked at any time in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services

---

### **Search and Map Data**

When you search for a destination by name or address:

- Your search queries are sent to Apple's MapKit services to find locations
- Results are scoped by your current location (so that you see relevant results)
- Apple processes these searches according to their privacy policy
- Search queries are not stored by WalkThere
- We do not have access to your search history

When navigating to destinations, the App may use Apple Maps data, which is governed by Apple's privacy practices.

### **Third-Party Services**

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not integrate with any external platforms except Apple's own frameworks (CoreLocation), which are subject to Apple's privacy policies.

---

### **Changes to This Policy**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the App Store listing and will take effect immediately upon posting.

### **Your Rights**

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- You have complete control over your data
- You can delete all data by deleting the App
- No data recovery is possible once the App is deleted (unless backed up to iCloud by Apple)
