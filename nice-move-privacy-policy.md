### **Third-Party Services**

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not integrate with any external platforms except Apple's own frameworks (WorkoutKit, HealthKit), which are subject to Apple's privacy policies.

### **Changes to This Policy**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the App Store listing and will take effect immediately upon posting.
